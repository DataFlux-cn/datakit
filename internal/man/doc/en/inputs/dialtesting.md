The collector collects the data of network dialing test results, and all the data generated by dialing test are reported to Guance Cloud.

## Private Test Node Deployment {#private-deploy}

=== "host installation"

    To deploy private dial-test nodes, you need to [create private dial-test nodes on Guance Cloud page](../usability-monitoring/self-node.md). When you're done, fill in the page with the relevant information in `conf.d/{{.Catalog}}/{{.InputName}}.conf`:
    
    Go to the `conf.d/{{.Catalog}}` directory under the DataKit installation directory, copy `{{.InputName}}.conf.sample` and name it `{{.InputName}}.conf`. Examples are as follows:
    
    ```toml
    # Dataway address
    server = "https://openway.guance.com"
    
    # require, node Unique Identification ID
    region_id = "reg_c2jlokxxxxxxxxxxx"
    
    # If server is assigned as the central task service address, it is necessary to configure the corresponding ak or sk
    ak = "ZYxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    sk = "BNFxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    
    [inputs.dialtesting.tags]
      # some_tag = "some_value"
      # more_tag = "some_other_value"
      # ...
    ```
    
    Once configured, [restart DataKit](datakit-service-how-to.md#manage-service).

=== "Kubernetes"

    The collector can now be turned on by [ConfigMap injection collector configuration](datakit-daemonset-deploy.md#configmap-setting).

???+ attention

    Currently, only linux dial-up nodes support, and the tracing data is stored in the [traceroute](#fields) field of the relevant metrics.

## Configuration {#config}

Go to the `conf.d/{{.Catalog}}` directory under the DataKit installation directory, copy `{{.InputName}}.conf.sample` and name it `{{.InputName}}.conf`. Examples are as follows:

```toml
{{.InputSample}}
```

After configuration, restart DataKit.

## Measurements {#measurements}

All of the following data collections are appended with a global tag named `host` by default (the tag value is the host name of the DataKit), or can be named in the configuration by `[[inputs.{{.InputName}}.tags]]` alternative host.

{{ range $i, $m := .Measurements }}

### `{{$m.Name}}`

-  tag

- metric list

## `traceroute` Field Description {#fields}

traceroute is the JSON text of the "route trace" data, and the entire data is an array object in which each array element records a route probe, as shown in the following example:

```json
[
    {
        "total": 2,
        "failed": 0,
        "loss": 0,
        "avg_cost": 12700395,
        "min_cost": 11902041,
        "max_cost": 13498750,
        "std_cost": 1129043,
        "items": [
            {
                "ip": "10.8.9.1",
                "response_time": 13498750
            },
            {
                "ip": "10.8.9.1",
                "response_time": 11902041
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "total": 2,
        "failed": 0,
        "loss": 0,
        "avg_cost": 13775021,
        "min_cost": 13740084,
        "max_cost": 13809959,
        "std_cost": 49409,
        "items": [
            {
                "ip": "10.12.168.218",
                "response_time": 13740084
            },
            {
                "ip": "10.12.168.218",
                "response_time": 13809959
            }
        ]
    }
]
```
