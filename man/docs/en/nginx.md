NGINX collector can take many metrics from NGINX instances, such as the total number of requests, connections, cache and other metrics, and collect the metrics into Guance Cloud to help monitor and analyze various abnormal situations of NGINX.

## Preconditions {#requirements}

- NGINX version >= 1.19.6

- NGINX collects the data of `http_stub_status_module` by default. When the `http_stub_status_module` is opened, see [here](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_stub_status_module.html){:target="_blank"}, which will report the data of NGINX measurements later.

- If you are using [VTS](https://github.com/vozlt/nginx-module-vts){:target="_blank"} or want to monitor more data, it is recommended to turn on VTS-related data collection by setting the option `use_vts` to `true` in `nginx.conf`. For how to start VTS, see [here](https://github.com/vozlt/nginx-module-vts#synopsis){:target="_blank"}.

- After VTS function is turned on, the following measurements can be generated:

    - `nginx`
    - `nginx_server_zone`
    - `nginx_upstream_zone` (NGINX needs to configure `upstream` related configuration)
    - `nginx_cache_zone`    (NGINX needs to configure `cache` related configuration)

- Take the example of generating the `nginx_upstream_zone` measurements. An example of NGINX-related configuration is as follows:

```
    ...
    http {
       ...
       upstream your-upstreamname {
         server upstream-ip:upstream-port;
      }
       server {
       ...
       location / {
       root  html;
       index  index.html index.htm;
       proxy_pass http://yourupstreamname;
     }}}

```

- After the VTS function has been turned on, it is no longer necessary to collect the data of the `http_stub_status_module` module, because the data of the VTS module will include the data of the `http_stub_status_module` module.

## Configuration {#config}

Go to the `conf.d/nginx` directory under the DataKit installation directory, copy `nginx.conf.sample` and name it `nginx.conf`. Examples are as follows:

```toml

[[inputs.nginx]]
	url = "http://localhost:80/server_status"
	# ##(optional) collection interval, default is 30s
	# interval = "30s"
	use_vts = false
	## Optional TLS Config
	# tls_ca = "/xxx/ca.pem"
	# tls_cert = "/xxx/cert.cer"
	# tls_key = "/xxx/key.key"
	## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
	insecure_skip_verify = false
	# HTTP response timeout (default: 5s)
	response_timeout = "20s"

    ## Set true to enable election
	election = true

	[inputs.nginx.log]
	#	files = ["/var/log/nginx/access.log","/var/log/nginx/error.log"]
	#	# grok pipeline script path
	#	pipeline = "nginx.p"
	[inputs.nginx.tags]
	# some_tag = "some_value"
	# more_tag = "some_other_value"
	# ...
```

After configuration, restart DataKit.

## Measurements {#measurements}

For all of the following data collections, a global tag named `host` is appended by default (the tag value is the host name of the DataKit), or other tags can be specified in the configuration by `[inputs.nginx.tags]`:

``` toml
 [inputs.nginx.tags]
  # some_tag = "some_value"
  # more_tag = "some_other_value"
  # ...
```

{{ range $i, $m := .Measurements }}

### `{{$m.Name}}`

- tag

{{$m.TagsMarkdownTable}}

- metric list

{{$m.FieldsMarkdownTable}}

{{ end }}




## Log Collection {#logging}

To collect NGINX logs, open `files` in NGINX.conf and write to the absolute path of the NGINX log file. For example:

```
    [[inputs.nginx]]
      ...
      [inputs.nginx.log]
		files = ["/var/log/nginx/access.log","/var/log/nginx/error.log"]
```


When log collection is turned on, logs with a log `source` of `nginx` are generated by default.

>Note: DataKit must be installed on the NGINX host to collect NGINX logs.


## Log Pipeline Feature Cut Field Description {#pipeline}

- NGINX error log cutting

Example error log text:
